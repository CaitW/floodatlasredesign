<p>Municipal practioners are seeking-out science-based solutions to the impacts of climate change and natural hazards, and asking how neighboring communities are becoming more resilient. The Great Lakes Coastal Resilience Planning Guide (GLCRPG), formulated through 3 years of grassroots and interagency collaboration, echoes this community-demanded approach to resilience building. This online guide is a hub for planners and practioners, who are encouraged to share proven-solutions, tools, maps and data, publications, best practices, and lessons learned. The GLCRPG facilitates this knowledge exchange through community-authored case studies, which provide explicit guidance on everything from what tools to use to best practices for implementation.</p>
