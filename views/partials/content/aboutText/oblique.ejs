<p>The <strong><a title="Link to Oblique Photo Viewer" href="http://floodatlas.org/wcmp/obliqueviewer">Great Lakes Coastal Oblique Photo Viewer</a></strong> is a project of the <a href="http://floods.org" target="_blank">Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM)</a> in association with the <a href="http://coastal.wisconsin.gov" target="_blank">Wisconsin Coastal Management Progra</a><a href="http://coastal.wisconsin.gov" target="_blank">m (WCM</a><a href="http://coastal.wisconsin.gov" target="_blank">P)</a> and the <a href="http://seagrant.wisc.edu" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute</a>. The Oblique Photos and Shoreline Inventory in this viewer are from the research of David Mickelson, Senior Scientist and Emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin. Professor Mickelsonâ€™s bluff and beach classification is the data behind the Shoreline Inventory. The Oblique Photos from 1976 and 2007-2008 are the basis for the classifications. The Great Lakes Coastal Oblique Photo Viewer is a by-product of that research and allows this important data to be accessible to anyone interested in coastal issues, and is made available through the Coastal Atlas project of the UW Sea Grant Institute. The Great Lakes Coastal Oblique Photo Viewer is built on a number of Open Source technologies, primarily the <a href="http://opengeo.org/technology/suite/" target="_blank">OpenGeo Suite Community Edition</a> which is a stack of Open Source projects that make it easier to produce web mapping applications.</p>
