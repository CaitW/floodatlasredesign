<p>The Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM) once again documented what States are doing in their floodplain management programs. The survey, titled <strong>Floodplain Management 2010: State &amp; Local Programs</strong> was conducted during the summer of 2010 and focused on providing the most complete national tally of floodplain management practices by State and Local governments. ASFPM has carried out similar surveys in 1989, 1992, 1995 and 2003. This detailed compilation of floodplain programs will allow you to see a summary of what is happening in the every state and allow comparison across different state programs.  The report can be found at <a href="http://floods.org/index.asp?menuID=730&amp;firstlevelmenuID=186&amp;siteID=1">ASFPMâ€™s FPM 2010 page</a>. The comprehensive data collected and stored in the database supported the writing and analysis found in the report, but the database can provide much more. For this reason, the Association of State Floodplain Managers has created this <strong><a title="Link to Survey Web Mapping Tool" href="http://floodatlas.org/survey/survey/map">Survey Web Mapping Tool</a></strong>, which provides access to the report along with new ways to view and compare the data.</p>
